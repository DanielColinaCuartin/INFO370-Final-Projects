    "The phrase \"don't judge a book by it's cover\" is perhaps the least used advice in America. And why not? With the sheer amount of information, books, apps, and articles it's practically impossible to make an informed decision on every single candidate. So it seems reasonable to pick from a few that catch your attention, and in the world of mobile applications the only advertisement you may see is a few words and an icon. \n",
    "\n",
    "So how can we as developers best entice people to our applications, using the few characters afforded in an application name? That is what we are setting out to learn. Through statistical and machine learning models, we hope to learn about the correlation between words in an app's title and that app's success, specifically in terms of user downloads.\n",

    "Naming decisions aren't the only decisions app developers/marketers face though, so we will also explore the effect an app's category, size, and other attributes have on installs."
